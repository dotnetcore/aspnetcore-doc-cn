What is Response Caching
------------------------
*Response caching* refers to specifying cache-related headers on HTTP responses made by ASP.NET MVC actions. These headers specify how you want client and intermediate (proxy) machines to cache responses to certain requests (if at all). This can reduce the number of requests a client or proxy makes to the web server, since future requests for the same action may be served from the client or proxy's cache. In this case, the request is never made to the web server.

The primary HTTP header used for caching is ``Cache-Control``. The `HTTP 1.1 specification <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.2>`_ details many options for this directive. Three common directives are:

public
  Indicates that the response may be cached.

private
  Indicates the response is intended for a single user and **must not** be cached by a shared cache. The response could still be cached in a private cache (for instance, by the user's browser).

no-cache
  Indicates the response **must not** be used by a cache to satisfy any subsequent request (without successful revalidation with the origin server).

.. note:: **Response caching does not cache responses on the web server**. It differs from `output caching <http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/controllers-and-routing/improving-performance-with-output-caching-cs>`_, which would cache responses in memory on the server in earlier versions of ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC. Output caching middleware is planned to be added to ASP.NET Core in a future release.

Additional HTTP headers used for caching include ``Pragma`` and ``Vary``, which are described below. Learn more about `Caching in HTTP from the specification <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-3>`_.

ResponseCache Attribute
-----------------------
The ResponseCacheAttribute_ is used to specify how a controller action's headers should be set to control its cache behavior. The attribute has the following properties, all of which are optional unless otherwise noted.

Duration ``int``
  The maximum duration (in seconds) the response should be cached. **Required** unless NoStore is ``true``.

Location ``ResponseCacheLocation``
  The location where the response may be cached. May be ``Any``, ``None``, or ``Client``. Default is ``Any``.

NoStore ``bool``
  Determines whether the value should be stored or not, and overrides other property values. When ``true``, ``Duration`` is ignored and ``Location`` is ignored for values other than ``None``.

VaryByHeader ``string``
  When set, a ``vary`` response header will be written with the response.

CacheProfileName ``string``
  When set, determines the name of the cache profile to use.

Order ``int``
  The order of the filter (from IOrderedFilter_).

The ResponseCacheAttribute_ is used to configure and create (via IFilterFactory_) a ResponseCacheFilter_, which performs the work of writing the appropriate HTTP headers to the response. The filter will first remove any existing headers for ``Vary``, ``Cache-Control``, and ``Pragma``, and then will write out the appropriate headers based on the properties set in the ResponseCacheAttribute_.

The ``Vary`` Header
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This header is only written when the ``VaryByHeader`` propery is set, in which case it is set to that property's value.

``NoStore`` and ``Location.None``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``NoStore`` is a special property that overrides most of the other properties. When this property is true, the ``Cache-Control`` header will be set to "no-store". Additionally, if ``Location`` is set to ``None``, then ``Cache-Control`` will be set to "no-store, no-cache" and ``Pragma`` is likewise set to ``no-cache``. (If ``NoStore`` is false and ``Location`` is ``None``, then both ``Cache-Control`` and ``Pragma`` will be set to ``no-cache``).

A good scenario in which to set ``NoStore`` to true is error pages. It's unlikely you would want to respond to a user's request with the error response a different user previously generated, and such responses may include stack traces and other sensitive information that shouldn't be stored on intermdiate servers. For example:

.. code-block:: c#

  [ResponseCache(Location = ResponseCacheLocation.None, NoStore = true)]
  public IActionResult Error()
  {
    return View();
  }

This will result in the following headers:

.. code-block:: javascript

  Cache-Control: no-store,no-cache
  Pragma: no-cache

Location and Duration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To enable caching, ``Duration`` must be set to a positive value and ``Location`` must be either ``Any`` (the default) or ``Client``. In this case, the ``Cache-Control`` header will be set to the location value followed by the "max-age" of the response.

.. note:: ``Location``'s options of ``Any`` and ``Client`` translate into ``Cache-Control`` header values of ``public`` and ``private``, respectively. As noted previously, setting ``Location`` to ``None`` will set both ``Cache-Control`` and ``Pragma`` headers to ``no-cache``.

Below is an example showing the headers produced by setting ``Duration`` and leaving the default ``Location`` value.

.. code-block:: c#

  [ResponseCache(Duration=60)]

Produces the following headers:

.. code-block:: javascript

  Cache-Control: public,max-age=60

Cache Profiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Instead of duplicating ``ResponseCache`` settings on many controller action attributes, cache profiles can be configured as options when setting up MVC in the ``ConfigureServices`` method in ``Startup``. Values found in a referenced cache profile will be used as the defaults by the ``ResponseCache`` attribute, and will be overridden by any properties specified on the attribute.

Setting up a cache profile:

.. literalinclude:: response-caching/sample/src/ResponseCacheSample/Startup.cs
  :linenos:
  :lines: 29-45
  :emphasize-lines: 5-15
  :dedent: 8
  :language: c#

Referencing a cache profile:

.. code-block:: c#

  [ResponseCache(CacheProfileName="Default")]

.. tip:: The ``ResponseCache`` attribute can be applied both to actions (methods) as well as controllers (classes). Method-level attributes will override the settings specified in class-level attributes.

In the following example, a class-level attribute specifies a duration of 30 while a method-level attributes references a cache profile with a duration set to 60.


.. literalinclude:: response-caching/sample/src/ResponseCacheSample/Controllers/HomeController.cs
  :linenos:
  :lines: 7-14
  :emphasize-lines: 1,4
  :dedent: 4
  :language: c#

The resulting header:

.. code-block:: javascript

  Cache-Control: public,max-age=60
